Paytm Problem Statement - 2
## Problem Statement Title
Using technology to create a credit profile of e-commerce customers.
## Problem Description
The e-commerce companies find it very difficult to profit since there are a lot of return backs and cancellations in e-commerce orders. Also even when orders are properly accepted the customer may want to pay by EMI. Thus there needs to be a system to create credit and buying profile of a customer. This has to be done in a way that it does not create a privacy issue for the customer.
Then based on that the system should give delivery benefits and EMI options to the user. So a customer who has a negative buying profile will not get Cash on Delivery option. Similarly, customers with negative credit profile will not get EMI options.
